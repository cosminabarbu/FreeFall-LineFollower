# LineFollower
10h hackathon as part of the final project for the Introduction to Robotics course at the University of Bucharest, where we're diving into making a line follower. It's a hands-on challenge where the requirement is to design a robot to follow a marked path accurately and in the shortest possible time. To achieve this, we used PID, a control loop mechanism employing feedback.

# Components used 
* Arduino uno
* Small breadboard
* L239D motor driver
* 2 DC motors
* 2 wheels
* A power source AKA a LiPo battery in our case
* QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor
* Ball caster
* Zip-ties, all types of wires, screws
* A foam board for the chassis

# Project design 
Our first (small) challenge for this project was making the chassis from a simple piece of foam board. Spoiler alert: we ended up nailing it. 

We started by mounting the ball caster and the QTR sensor with their screws in the front of our car. We then began placing the remaining components in various forms before getting the best setup: the Arduino uno board was placed in the center of the chassis, making it easy for us to connect the USB cable to the laptop for uploading the code. As for the LiPo battery, we secured it under the chassis for giving our little car a lower center of gravity and perfectly balancing the center-back area where only the small breaboard was placed,right between the two motor-wheel pairs. 

After making sure that all of the mechanical aspects were perfected, we gave life to our car by adding small details that would make it stand out.
